Agentic AI Study Planner using Endee Project Overview Many students find it hard to create effective study plans. They often struggle with prioritizing topics, lack of structure, and using their study time efficiently. Most traditional study planners are not dynamic and do not adapt to the complexity and connections within the syllabus content. This project introduces an Agentic AI Study Planner that creates a personalized, day-by-day study plan for students. The system uses vector-based memory and reasoning to understand syllabus topics on a deeper level and organize them intelligently. Endee serves as the vector database, storing syllabus concepts and allowing retrieval through semantic search. This helps the AI agent reason about the syllabus and develop a structured, realistic study schedule. Problem Statement Conventional study planners have some clear drawbacks: They treat all topics as equally important. They do not consider topic difficulty or learning dependencies. They lack memory, reasoning, and adaptability. Because of these issues, students often feel overwhelmed. They may spend too much time on low-priority topics while ignoring more important ones. Solution Approach The Agentic AI Study Planner tackles these challenges by blending agent-based reasoning with vector search: It understands syllabus topics based on their meaning rather than just keywords. It identifies complex and high-priority topics using semantic similarity. It adjusts the study plan according to time limits and learning goals. It produces a clear, understandable day-by-day study schedule. This method helps students focus on the right topics at the right time. System Design and Technical Approach Architecture Flow Syllabus Input The student submits the syllabus topics along with the available study period (number of days). This input kicks off the planning process. Vector Storage using Endee Each syllabus topic is transformed into vector embeddings and stored in Endee, which serves as the vector-based knowledge memory. Semantic Retrieval The system retrieves relevant topics from Endee through vector similarity search, allowing for the identification of related concepts and dependencies. Agentic Reasoning An AI agent evaluates topic complexity, priority, and available study time to determine the best order for studying. Study Plan Generation The system creates a personalized, day-by-day study plan that is logically structured, easy to follow, and focuses on effective exam preparation.
